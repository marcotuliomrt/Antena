### Motivation
Despite electromagnetic induction was first performed in the mid-19th century, until recently the technology that uses this property is somewhat inefficient over long distances between the emitter and the receiver. This project aims to mathematically model a two-antenna system performing induction to analyze its limitations based on power transmission and distance between antennas.

### Modelling steps
#### 1. Create the emitter antenna
#### 2. Find the impedance and resonance frequency 
#### 3. Create the transmitter antenna
#### 4. Simulate the antennas coupling
#### 5. Visualize the gains
#### 6. Visualize the gains as a function of frequency and distance
#### 7. Calculate the resonant current
#### 8.
